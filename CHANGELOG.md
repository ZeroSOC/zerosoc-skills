# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Process lineage from the evidence.** Triage and investigation rebuild the parent/child process chain
  of a Case with `scripts/process_chain.py`, from the rows of the evidence inventory: one node per
  process (device, PID, creation time) keeping every row's verdict, parents joined on PID and creation
  time with precision-aware times, lineage gaps for parents outside the evidence, anomalies reported, and
  timeline entries with their alerts as event references for the Case Timeline. The default view is one
  chain per alert, each process under its ancestors, as an alert story is read; ancestors contributed by the
  Case's other alerts are marked as context, and `--case` joins every alert into one chain per device.

## v0.2.0 (2026-09-17) — conforms to zerosoc-framework@b9c29f0

Fixes found running the three skills end to end against a live Incident.

- **Evidence inventory as a step.** Triage and investigation extract the Case's evidence before the
  ledger is started and record a completeness check (`scripts/evidence_inventory.py`: de-duplicated
  entities joined to their device, extracted count against the source's count). The decision scripts
  print a note when the inventory is missing, unverified or incomplete.
- **Reference binding for a licensing-limited deployment.**
  `capabilities/zerosoc.capabilities.defender-for-business.json` answers every data source the playbooks
  name, so playbook selection reports real visibility gaps with their reason instead of `unbound`. The
  binding schema gains the optional `data_source_notes` and `alert_type_map`.
- **Deterministic alert types.** `scripts/alert_types.py` maps source alerts to framework alert types
  from a deployment map (`capabilities/alert_types.defender-xdr.json`) and collapses the same type on the
  same entity; `resolve.py` counts alert findings of one type on one entity once.
- **Measured timebox.** `resolve.py` computes the investigation timebox from `started_at` to `--now`,
  `resolved_at` or the current time, against the severity-scaled reference value, which
  `timebox_minutes` may tighten and never extend; a self-reported `timebox_expired` is a labelled
  fallback; timestamps out of order are reported.
- **Re-pinned** to the framework's head (`b9c29f0`; no change in the mirrored documents since
  `bba8527`).
- **Retrospective sweep through the case store.** Investigation binds the 90-day sweep to `cases.store`,
  never to telemetry with a shorter retention.

## v0.1.0 (2026-09-15)

Triage, investigation and response skills with the coverage rule, the resolution rule and the containment
autonomy matrix as scripts.
