# Identity Triage Playbook

Triage knowledge for **Identity** alerts. The object of triage is the **Alert**; alert types are defined in the [Alert Type taxonomy](../../02-Taxonomy/alert_types.md). The method — enrichment, scope, the coverage rule that closes or promotes a Case — is [Detection & Analysis §1](../../03-Processes/02-detection_and_analysis.md#1-phase-2a--triage-verification-enrichment--prioritization); this playbook says what to look at for each alert type and what each observation is evidence of. Checks and conditions are indicative, not exhaustive.

## Alert Catalog

One row per alert type of this domain; each row is the index into a subsection of [Per-Alert Triage](#per-alert-triage). Tactics and techniques are the candidates an alert type may map to, not a conjunction.

| Alert Type | Log Source | Tactics | Techniques | Candidate Incident Categories |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Impossible-travel / anomalous sign-in | IdP / CASB | Initial Access | T1078 (Valid Accounts) | IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack), IC-02 (Business Email Compromise) |
| Brute force / password spray | IdP | Credential Access | T1110 (Brute Force) | IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack) |
| MFA fatigue / push bombing | IdP | Credential Access | T1621 (Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation) | IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack) |
| Legacy-auth sign-in | IdP | Initial Access | T1078 (Valid Accounts) | IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack), IC-02 (Business Email Compromise) |
| OAuth app consent / token-session theft | IdP / CASB | Persistence | T1528 (Steal Application Access Token), T1550.001 (Application Access Token) | IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack), IC-02 (Business Email Compromise) |
| Privileged role / group grant | IdP | Privilege Escalation | T1098 (Account Manipulation) | IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack), IC-09 (Insider Threat & Privilege Misuse) |

## Per-Alert Triage

### Impossible-travel / anomalous sign-in

- **Enrich entities:** [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md) (source IP).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Access policy and device compliance.** Did the sign-in pass or fail the identity provider's access policy, and was the device managed and compliant? → `Malicious (Medium)` when the policy failed or the device is unmanaged on an improbable-geography sign-in; `Benign (Low)` when a managed, compliant device passed the policy — routine, but a stolen session replayed through a managed device passes too.
  2. **Baseline deviation.** Is the geography/ASN/device combination genuinely new for this user, or within their established roaming pattern (frequent traveler, known VPN egress)? → `Malicious (Medium)` when the combination is new for the user; `Benign (Medium)` when it matches the user's established pattern. Deviation from the baseline is the core signal, not velocity alone.
  3. **Source reputation.** Does the source IP resolve to a corporate VPN or proxy egress, a consumer ISP, or threat-intelligence-flagged infrastructure? → `Benign (High)` when it is a recognized corporate VPN or proxy egress — the "impossible" travel is an artifact of the egress point; `Malicious (High)` when it is threat-intelligence-flagged or anonymizing infrastructure; context for a consumer ISP.
  4. **Travel confirmation.** Does a travel record, a calendar entry or the user's own confirmation through an independent channel place them at the sign-in location? → `Benign (High)` when it does; `Malicious (High)` when the user denies the sign-in; context when no confirmation is obtainable.
- **False Positive conditions:** corporate VPN or proxy egress producing geo-velocity artifacts; a cloud-hosted mail or sync client signing in on the user's behalf from the provider's region; an IP-geolocation error placing a mobile-carrier address in the wrong country.
- **Benign conditions:** legitimate user travel or roaming; a documented remote-work location or a recorded exception for the user.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack); IC-02 (Business Email Compromise) when the account is a mailbox user and the sign-in is followed by mail access.

### Brute force / password spray

- **Enrich entities:** [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md) (source IP).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Failure pattern.** Are failures concentrated on one account (brute force) or spread thin across many accounts from one or few sources (spray)? → `Malicious (Medium)` when the shape is a spray — one attempt per account across many accounts — or a sustained brute force on one account from an external source; `Benign (Medium)` when failures repeat against one service account from the same client at machine-regular intervals, the shape of broken automation.
  2. **Source concentration.** Do failures originate from a small set of IPs/ASNs, especially threat-intelligence-flagged or anonymizing infrastructure, or from a known automation or service endpoint? → `Malicious (High)` when the sources are threat-intelligence-flagged or anonymizing infrastructure; `Benign (High)` when the source is an identified internal automation or application host and its failing credential is confirmed, or it is the declared source of an authorized password audit or penetration test whose recorded scope covers the accounts and the window — the failures are explained; `Malicious (Low)` for an unknown external source.
  3. **Outcome.** Did any attempt succeed? → `Malicious (High)` when a sign-in succeeded from an attempting source, especially on an account that failed earlier in the same campaign; context when every attempt failed and lockout held — the outcome changes the severity, not the side.
- **False Positive conditions:** broken automation or a misconfigured service account retrying a stale credential; a lockout storm from a single legitimate application hammering the identity provider; a threshold counting many users behind one NAT egress as a single attacking source.
- **Benign conditions:** an authorized password audit or penetration test whose documented scope covers the accounts and the window.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack).

### MFA fatigue / push bombing

- **Enrich entities:** [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Prompt volume and timing.** How many push prompts fired in how short a window, and from how many distinct sign-in attempts? → `Malicious (Medium)` on a rapid burst of prompts from distinct sign-in attempts the user did not initiate; `Benign (Low)` when a handful of prompts repeat from one sign-in attempt at retry-sized intervals.
  2. **Requesting source.** Are the underlying sign-in attempts coming from an unfamiliar geography/ASN/device rather than the user's own client? → `Malicious (High)` when an unfamiliar requester drives the prompts — someone else holds the password; `Benign (High)` when every attempt traces to the user's enrolled device on its usual network — the retries are the user's own.
  3. **Eventual response.** Did the user approve, deny or ignore? → `Malicious (High)` when an approval followed repeated denials from an unfamiliar source — successful coercion; `Malicious (Medium)` when an approval came from an unfamiliar source without prior denials; context when every prompt was denied or ignored — the coercion failed, the credential is still compromised.
  4. **User confirmation.** Does the user, reached through an independent channel, confirm initiating the sign-ins? → `Benign (High)` when they confirm and describe the failing prompt; `Malicious (High)` when they deny initiating them.
- **False Positive conditions:** the user's own client retrying a genuinely failing prompt (network issue, app bug); a detection counting the re-sent prompts of a single sign-in attempt as separate attempts.
- **Benign conditions:** an authorized security-awareness exercise that sends test prompts, recorded for the user and the window; a user enrolling a new authenticator and triggering prompts during setup.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack).

### Legacy-auth sign-in

- **Enrich entities:** [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Client identification.** Does the client or user-agent match a known legacy application (an old mail client, a printer or scanner integration), or is it unidentifiable or scripted? → `Benign (Medium)` when it matches a legacy client recorded in the asset inventory; `Malicious (Medium)` when the client is unidentifiable or scripted.
  2. **Baseline recurrence.** Is this a recurring, previously seen legacy client for this user, or a first-time occurrence? → `Benign (Medium)` when the same client has signed in for this user routinely; `Malicious (Medium)` when a legacy client appears for the first time on an established account.
  3. **Source of the sign-in.** Where did it originate? → `Benign (High)` when it comes from the inventoried legacy device's own address on the internal network under a recorded exception — the sign-in is explained; `Malicious (Medium)` when it comes from an external address the device never uses.
  4. **Correlated risk.** Does the sign-in coincide with an impossible-travel, brute-force or MFA alert on the same account? → `Malicious (High)` when it does — legacy authentication is the MFA-bypass path attackers pivot to after credential theft; context when isolated.
  5. **Credential validity on a blocked attempt.** When the identity provider rejected the attempt on protocol grounds, was the password correct? → `Malicious (Medium)` when the password was accepted and only the protocol block stopped the session — whoever tried holds a valid credential; context when the password was wrong.
- **False Positive conditions:** a parser classifying a modern client as a legacy protocol on a malformed user-agent; a rule that flags a protocol the identity provider already blocks, so the "sign-in" is a rejected attempt with no session — provided the password was wrong; a correct password stopped only by the protocol block is a Malicious finding (check 5), not a False Positive.
- **Benign conditions:** an old client (a legacy printer or scanner, an old mail client) that only speaks basic authentication and has done so consistently, with a recorded exception.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack); IC-02 (Business Email Compromise) when the legacy protocol is a mail protocol.

### OAuth app consent / token-session theft

- **Enrich entities:** [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **App provenance and scope.** Is the application publisher-verified, and does the requested scope (mail read, files, offline access) exceed what the app plausibly needs? → `Malicious (Medium)` on broad scopes from an unverified publisher — the consent-phishing pattern; `Benign (Medium)` when the publisher is verified and the scopes fit the app's stated function.
  2. **Grant or session origin.** Was the grant or token use initiated by the legitimate user session, or does it follow a prior credential or MFA alert on the account? → `Malicious (High)` when the token is used from a different device or IP than the session that obtained it, or the grant follows a credential alert — adversary-in-the-middle token theft; `Benign (Low)` when grant and use come from the user's usual device and network.
  3. **Post-grant activity.** Does the app or session immediately enumerate mail or files, or create inbox rules? → `Malicious (High)` on rapid collection activity after the grant; `Benign (Low)` when activity stays within the app's stated function.
  4. **Sanctioning status.** Is the app on the sanctioned list, or was the grant issued through the approved consent workflow? → `Benign (High)` for a consent alert when it is — the consent is explained; context for a token-use alert — a stolen token is used precisely against sanctioned apps, so sanctioning says nothing about who holds the token; context when the app is unknown to the organization.
- **False Positive conditions:** a rule that flags every consent regardless of publisher verification and scope, with no allowlist; a token-replay detection triggered by a client that legitimately refreshes its token from a changed network (a phone moving between networks).
- **Benign conditions:** sanctioned app onboarding through the approved consent workflow; an administrator's tenant-wide consent for an integration under change control.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack); IC-02 (Business Email Compromise) when mail scopes are granted or mail is collected.

### Privileged role / group grant

- **Enrich entities:** [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md) (grantor and grantee), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md) (source of the grant call).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Change-control correlation.** Does the grant tie to an approved access request or change ticket? → `Benign (High)` when a ticket names the grantee and the role and the grantor is the administrator the ticket assigns or the access-management workflow's own identity, or the grant is a time-bound just-in-time activation by an eligible administrator within their approved scope — the grant is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when a ticket names the grantee and the role but the grantor is not the one it names; `Malicious (Medium)` when the grant is untracked.
  2. **Grantor legitimacy.** Was the grant made by an authorized privileged-access administrator, or by an account with no prior role-management activity? → `Benign (Low)` when the grantor routinely manages roles; `Malicious (Medium)` when the grantor is a first-time or anomalous role manager, or the grant was made through an unusual path (a direct API call rather than the access-management workflow).
  3. **Grantee risk.** Is the grantee an existing, active account consistent with the role, or a dormant, recently created or external account? → `Malicious (Medium)` when privilege is granted to a dormant, new or external account — an escalation or persistence signal, but new-hire administrators and partner guests receive roles routinely, so it needs a second signal; `Benign (Low)` when the grantee is an established account whose function matches the role.
- **False Positive conditions:** a rule that fires on the renewal or re-evaluation of an existing eligible assignment as if it were a new grant; a group the rule lists as privileged that no longer carries privileges.
- **Benign conditions:** an approved access change executed through the standard privileged-access workflow; a time-bound just-in-time activation by an eligible administrator within their approved scope.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack); IC-09 (Insider Threat & Privilege Misuse) when the grantor is a legitimate administrator acting outside process.
