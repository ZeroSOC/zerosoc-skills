# Endpoint Triage Playbook

> **Draft.** This playbook has not been verified in detail: its checks, outcome tags and actions have not been walked through against real material. Treat it as a proposal open to review rather than as guidance to follow, and expect it to change.

Triage knowledge for **Endpoint** alerts. The object of triage is the **Alert**; alert types are defined in the [Alert Type taxonomy](../../02-Taxonomy/alert_types.md). The method — enrichment, scope, the coverage rule that closes or promotes a Case — is [Detection & Analysis §1](../../03-Processes/02-detection_and_analysis.md#1-phase-2a--triage-verification-enrichment--prioritization); this playbook says what to look at for each alert type and what each observation is evidence of. Checks and conditions are indicative, not exhaustive.

## Alert Catalog

One row per alert type of this domain; each row is the index into a subsection of [Per-Alert Triage](#per-alert-triage). Tactics and techniques are the candidates an alert type may map to, not a conjunction.

## Per-Alert Triage

### Malware / loader execution

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Hash reputation.** Does a multi-engine lookup of the file hash name a known malware family? → `Malicious (High)` on a family consensus; `Benign (Medium)` when the hash is a known, signed vendor release; context when the hash is unknown — an unknown hash is not evidence of either side.
  2. **Payload location.** Where does the executed or dropped file live? → `Malicious (Medium)` when it runs from a world-writable path (`C:\Users\Public\`, `%TEMP%`, `Downloads`); `Benign (Low)` when it runs from a sanctioned install location.
  3. **Execution parent.** What launched it? → `Malicious (High)` when an office document or a script host spawned an execution utility — the macro-delivery chain that business software rarely produces; `Benign (Low)` when the parent is an installer, a management agent or an interactive shell of an administrator.
  4. **Child processes.** What did the executed file go on to spawn? → `Malicious (High)` when it spawned a shell, a script interpreter or system utilities that discover the environment, read credentials or disable recovery — what the process did next shows its intent, which the file and its parent alone do not; `Benign (Low)` when the children are the product's own components — an installer unpacking and launching its signed binaries; context when it spawned nothing — a payload that has not acted yet is not evidence of either side. A child process that fired its own Alert in the Case is assessed under that alert type and not counted again here.
  5. **Proxy execution.** Is a trusted, signed system binary (`regsvr32`, `rundll32`, `mshta`) running code from a non-system path? → `Malicious (Medium)`; `Benign (Low)` when the loaded library sits in a sanctioned install location.
  6. **Deployment record.** Does a management-platform deployment record name this host and this package, or is the host a designated developer or test host building its own binaries? → `Benign (High)` when the record names the host and the package and the executed file's hash or signature matches it, or the file is the designated build host's own output — the execution is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when a record names the host and the package but the executed hash or signature cannot be matched to it; context when nothing records the execution — absence of a record does not establish intent.
- **False Positive conditions:** a heuristic firing on signed vendor software; a detection keyed on a file name that a legitimate product also uses; a packed but legitimate installer.
- **Benign conditions:** an authorized deployment or installation by the endpoint management platform; a developer or test host building local binaries; a security engineer or tester running a sample on a designated analysis host as authorized work.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-05 (Commodity Malware / Loader); IC-03 (Ransomware & Digital Extortion) if ransomware behaviors follow.

### Suspicious script / interpreter execution

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md) ([File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md) if a script artifact exists).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Command-line intent.** If the command line is encoded or obfuscated (Base64 `-enc`, string concatenation, compression), decode it: what does it do? → `Malicious (Medium)` when the decoded command makes network connections, writes files or modifies the registry; `Benign (Medium)` when it decodes to something inert or to a known administrative script.
  2. **Execution lineage.** What launched the interpreter? → `Malicious (High)` when a document or a script host spawned it; `Benign (Low)` when an administrator's interactive session or a management agent did.
  3. **Child processes.** What did the interpreter go on to launch? → `Malicious (High)` when it launched a burst of discovery commands (`whoami`, `net`, `nltest`), a credential or recovery-sabotage utility, or a further download or proxy-execution binary; `Benign (Medium)` when the children are the commands the recorded administrative script or management job is known to run; context when it launched nothing. A child process that fired its own Alert in the Case is assessed under that alert type and not counted again here.
  4. **Download cradle.** Does the script fetch and run remote content (`DownloadString`, `Invoke-WebRequest` to raw content, `IEX`)? → `Malicious (High)` when it fetches from an external host and executes the result; `Benign (Low)` for local-only scripting.
  5. **Change or agent record.** Is the execution recorded — an approved change naming the host, the window and the script, a job the remote-management platform logged for this host, or a detection test recorded for the host and the window? → `Benign (High)` when the record names the script or job and the running account or parent process is the one it names — the assigned administrator, the management agent, the named tester — the execution is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when a change window covers the host and the time but names neither the script nor the account; context when nothing is recorded.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection firing on obfuscation that a legitimate product's installer or updater uses; an encoded command that decodes to a benign vendor routine.
- **Benign conditions:** authorized IT scripting in an approved change window; a remote-management agent using the interpreter; detection testing by a verified team member on a designated host.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-05 (Commodity Malware / Loader).

### Credential dumping

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Access target.** What did the process read, and on what host? → context that sets the severity, not the side — the access is what fired and is not counted again: LSASS memory, the SAM and SYSTEM hives or `ntds.dit` on a domain controller expose every credential of the domain and set the Case severity per [Definitions §7](../../01-Foundation/definitions.md#7-classification-levels); the same read on a workstation exposes local credentials only.
  2. **Access technique.** How was it read? → `Malicious (High)` when a minidump of LSASS was written, or `comsvcs.dll MiniDump`, `procdump` or direct system calls were used; context for a routine in-process memory read.
  3. **Accessor identity.** What is the accessing process? → `Benign (High)` when it is a sanctioned, signed security or backup agent that reads protected memory by design on every host; `Malicious (Medium)` when it is unsigned, oddly parented, unknown to the asset inventory, or went on to spawn an archiving or transfer utility against the dump it wrote.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection that fires on every handle to LSASS, including the EDR's own; a signed security product not yet on the detection's allowlist.
- **Benign conditions:** sanctioned forensic or incident-response tooling reading LSASS during an authorized engagement; a credential-manager operation by the platform itself.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack).

### Remote execution / lateral movement

- **Enrich entities:** [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md) (source and target hosts), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md) (the account used), [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Mechanism.** How was access or execution achieved on the target — a service registered and started, a management interface invoked remotely, a write to an administrative share, a task created on the target? → context that sets the severity, not the side — the mechanism is what fired and is not counted again. A service or task left behind on the target raises the persistence question separately, under that alert type.
  2. **Account and authentication.** Which account was used, and how did it authenticate? → `Malicious (High)` when the account is one a credential-access alert in this Case already names, or when authentication presented a hash or a ticket rather than the account's own credential; `Malicious (Medium)` when the account has no administrative relationship to the target; `Benign (Low)` when it is the target's recorded administrator or a service account whose normal work this is.
  3. **Source role.** Does the source host reach others by design — a management server, a deployment point, a jump server? → `Benign (High)` when the source is a recorded management host and the target falls in its scope; `Malicious (Medium)` when the source is a workstation, or a server with no administrative role over the target.
  4. **Fan-out.** How many distinct targets did the source reach in the window, and how quickly? → `Malicious (High)` when one source reached many targets in a short window, or reached hosts of unrelated function; `Benign (Low)` for a single pair that the source's role explains.
  5. **What ran on the target.** What did the remote execution launch there? → `Malicious (High)` when it launched discovery commands, a credential-access utility, a recovery-sabotage command, or a further transfer; `Benign (Medium)` when the children are those the recorded deployment or administrative job is known to run; context when it launched nothing. A child process that fired its own Alert in the Case is assessed under that alert type and not counted again here.
  6. **Change or agent record.** Is the activity recorded — an approved change naming the source, the targets and the window, a job the deployment or remote-management platform logged, or a detection test recorded for these hosts? → `Benign (High)` when the record names the account and the targets — the movement is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when a change window covers the hosts and the time but names neither the account nor the targets; context when nothing is recorded.
- **False Positive conditions:** a deployment, patch-management or inventory tool that reaches hosts by the same mechanisms an attacker would; a monitoring or backup agent authenticating to its targets on a schedule; a detection counting one administrative session as movement.
- **Benign conditions:** authorized remote administration in an approved change window; a software deployment or patch run from a recorded management host; an authorized penetration test whose scope names the source host and the window.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-06 (Identity & Credential Attack) when the movement rides on stolen credential material; IC-08 (Infrastructure Compromise) when it reaches servers or domain infrastructure; IC-03 (Ransomware & Digital Extortion) when it precedes or accompanies encryption.

### Ransomware mass-encryption

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Modification pattern.** Is a single process rewriting many files across directories with rising entropy or changed extensions in a short window? → `Malicious (High)` on that fan-out pattern; `Benign (Low)` when a few files changed under an editor or a sync client.
  2. **Recovery sabotage.** Did the process delete volume shadow copies or disable recovery (`vssadmin Delete Shadows`, `wmic shadowcopy delete`, `bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no`)? → `Malicious (High)` when an unsigned process, a script or an interactive command did it — there is no business reason to destroy restore points outside a documented decommissioning; `Benign (Medium)` when a signed backup agent's scheduled job pruned old shadow copies in its cleanup routine — backup agents do this by design, and the pruning alone does not explain an encryption alert.
  3. **Ransom-note artifacts.** Were note files dropped into the affected directories? → `Malicious (High)`.
  4. **Encrypting-process provenance.** What is the process? → `Benign (High)` when it is a signed backup, archiving or full-disk-encryption tool running its scheduled job or a rollout the endpoint management platform records for this host; `Malicious (Medium)` when it is an unsigned binary from a user path.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection firing on the write pattern of a backup, archiving or compression job; a bulk rename or migration by a signed tool; a rule keyed on the shadow-copy deletion command alone firing on a signed backup agent's scheduled cleanup.
- **Benign conditions:** an authorized full-disk-encryption rollout by the endpoint management platform; a scheduled backup job on its usual window.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-03 (Ransomware & Digital Extortion).

### Security-tool / AMSI tampering

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Tampering action.** What control was touched? → `Malicious (High)` for an in-memory AMSI bypass, an event-tracing patch, or the EDR's tamper protection disabled; `Malicious (Medium)` for a stopped AV service or an added exclusion.
  2. **Change authorization.** Was the change made under an approved maintenance or change window by IT or security? → `Benign (High)` when the change ticket covers the host and the action and the acting account or process is the one the ticket names — the assigned engineer or the named deployment package; `Benign (Medium)` when the ticket covers the host and the window but not the actor — an attacker acting inside an open maintenance window satisfies the window alone; `Malicious (Medium)` when a standard user or an unexpected process made it.
  3. **Surrounding activity.** Is the tampering chained with execution, persistence or credential alerts on the same host in the same window? → `Malicious (High)` when it clears the way for other suspicious activity; context when isolated.
- **False Positive conditions:** the security product's own upgrade routine stopping and restarting its services; a detection firing on an exclusion added by the product's installer.
- **Benign conditions:** an authorized security-software maintenance or migration window; an administrator adding a documented exclusion under change control.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-05 (Commodity Malware / Loader); IC-03 (Ransomware & Digital Extortion) if pre-ransomware defense evasion.

### Persistence mechanism created

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Mechanism and target.** What was created (Run key, scheduled task, service, WMI event subscription, startup-folder entry) and what does it launch? → `Malicious (Medium)` when the target is an unsigned binary or a script in a world-writable path; `Benign (High)` when the entry matches a sanctioned administrative task recorded in the Knowledge Base — same target, same parameters — the creation is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when it is a signed program in its install location.
  2. **Creating process.** What created it? → `Benign (High)` when the management platform's deployment record names the host and the package and the entry launches that package's signed binary from its install location — the entry is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when a known installer or the management agent did with no matching record; `Malicious (High)` when a document-spawned process or a script host did.
  3. **Timing correlation.** Was it created right after an execution or download alert on the same host? → `Malicious (Medium)` — the foothold being made durable, but every legitimate installer follows the same sequence, and an installer chain that explains the earlier alert explains this one too; context otherwise.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection firing on the autostart entries every installation of a legitimate product creates.
- **Benign conditions:** a software install or update by the endpoint management platform; a sanctioned administrative scheduled task.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-05 (Commodity Malware / Loader).

### Ingress tool transfer to host

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Downloader identity.** What fetched the file? → `Malicious (Medium)` when a living-off-the-land binary (`certutil`, `bitsadmin`, `curl`, `powershell`) did; `Benign (Low)` when a browser or a package manager did.
  2. **Source reputation.** What is the reputation and registration age of the source? → `Malicious (High)` when threat intelligence flags the source; `Malicious (Low)` when it is merely newly registered — young domains are common among legitimate new sites — or `Malicious (Medium)` when a newly registered source also delivered a payload that was written and run; `Benign (Medium)` for a well-known vendor or an internal repository.
  3. **Landing and follow-on.** Where did the file land, was it executed, and what did it spawn when it ran? → `Malicious (High)` when it was written to a world-writable path and run shortly after; `Benign (Low)` when it sits inert in `Downloads`.
  4. **Delivery record.** Is the transfer a content delivery the management platform recorded for this host, or a fetch from the sanctioned internal repository? → `Benign (High)` when the delivery record names the host and the package and the written file's hash matches it, or the source is the sanctioned internal repository and the fetching account is an administrator in their own interactive session — the transfer is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when a delivery record names the host but the written file cannot be matched to it; context when nothing records the transfer.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection firing on a package manager or a browser download by command-line shape alone.
- **Benign conditions:** content delivery by the management agent; an administrator fetching tools from a sanctioned internal repository.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-05 (Commodity Malware / Loader).

### Trusted software / updater anomalous behaviour

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md), [Network observable](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_network.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Child processes.** What did the trusted binary spawn? → `Malicious (High)` when a signed application or updater spawned a shell, a script interpreter or a system utility it has no reason to run; `Benign (Low)` when the children are the product's own components.
  2. **Loaded libraries.** Did the binary load a library from outside its install location, or one whose signer differs from the product's? → `Malicious (High)` on a side-loaded library; `Benign (Low)` when every library is signed by the publisher and sits in place.
  3. **Network behaviour.** Where did the binary connect? → `Malicious (High)` when it beacons to infrastructure that is not the publisher's, especially newly registered; `Benign (Medium)` when it reached only the publisher's update domains.
  4. **Fleet prevalence.** Is the same version behaving the same way on many hosts after the same update? → `Malicious (Medium)` when a supply-chain compromise would explain it and the behaviour is new for the version and undocumented; `Benign (High)` when the binary is signed by the publisher, the publisher's release notes document the new behaviour and every host that received the same update behaves identically — the behaviour is the update's, and the alert is explained; `Benign (Medium)` when the release notes document the behaviour but a fleet-wide comparison is not available.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection baselined on the previous version's behaviour firing on a legitimate update; a product feature newly using a scripting engine.
- **Benign conditions:** a documented product update rolled out by the endpoint management platform whose new behaviour matches the publisher's notes.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-10 (Supply-Chain Compromise); IC-05 (Commodity Malware / Loader) when the trojanized binary is the loader itself.

### Mass file destruction / disk wipe

- **Enrich entities:** [Process](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [File](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_artifact.md), [User](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_identity.md), [Device](../99-Shared/sub_enrichment_asset.md).
- **Checks:**
  1. **Destruction pattern.** Is a single process deleting or overwriting many files across directories, or writing to the boot record, partition table or volume metadata? → `Malicious (High)` on raw writes to boot or volume structures; `Malicious (Medium)` on a bulk overwrite pattern; `Benign (Low)` for a bulk delete inside a single application's data directory.
  2. **Recovery sabotage.** Were shadow copies, backups or recovery settings destroyed first? → `Malicious (High)`.
  3. **Process provenance and authorization.** What is the process, and is there a decommissioning or re-imaging task for this host? → `Benign (High)` when a signed imaging or disk-management tool runs under a change ticket naming the host and the acting account or deployment task is the one the ticket names; `Benign (Medium)` when the ticket names the host but not the actor or the task; `Malicious (Medium)` when the process is unsigned or the host is not scheduled for decommissioning.
  4. **Scope.** Is the same activity starting on other hosts in the same minutes? → `Malicious (Medium)` — a wiper propagating, but a mass re-imaging job starts fleet-wide in the same minutes too; `Malicious (High)` when check 3 also finds no ticket or an unsigned process; context when confined to one host.
- **False Positive conditions:** a detection firing on a disk-cleanup or storage-reclaim job by a signed tool; a large delete by a sync client after a folder was unshared.
- **Benign conditions:** a sanctioned decommissioning or re-imaging task by the endpoint management platform under change control.
- **Candidate Incident Category(ies):** IC-13 (Destructive / Wiper Attack); IC-03 (Ransomware & Digital Extortion) when the destruction follows an extortion demand.
