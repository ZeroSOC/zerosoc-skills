# Agentic Governance & Guardrail Protocols

> **Draft.** This document states the controls the operating loop depends on — least access, the approval request, the human assignee conditions, data egress and metering — and no more. Its expansion, including the per-function capability matrix, is tracked on the [Roadmap](../01-Foundation/roadmap.md). Expect it to change in a later release.

Automation and agents act in the environment with real privileges. This document sets the boundaries within which they act, so that every action is attributable, reversible where it can be, approved where it must be, and under human accountability for what matters most. The controls apply to any executor; where a control concerns a resource only one executor class consumes — tokens — the text says so.

## 1. Least Access Identity Plane

Automation and agents do not operate with standing, highly privileged accounts.

*   **Just-in-time scoping:** an executor requests permissions scoped to the query, enrichment or containment action it is about to perform on the Case at hand.
*   **Token lifetime:** the credential expires when the action completes or the Case leaves the executor.
*   **Auditability:** every API call is logged centrally and attributed to the Case that drove it.

## 2. The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Presentation Payload

An action that requires approval under the containment autonomy matrix of [Incident Response §2.1](../03-Processes/03-response.md#21-risk-based-autonomy-matrix-for-containment) is requested with the payload below, whoever the executor is: a human analyst asking the SOC Manager to isolate a production server submits the same payload an agent does. The payload is what the approver decides on; the decision — approved, modified, rejected — is recorded in the Case timeline, and a rejection is an overturn source for [Operational Metrics §5.4](../05-Metrics/operational_metrics.md).

1.  **Context:** the Incident Category, the Case severity and confidence, and in plain language why the Malicious hypothesis was proven — the score and the findings that carry it ([Detection & Analysis §2.4](../03-Processes/02-detection_and_analysis.md#24-hypothesis-resolution-verdict-and-confidence)).
2.  **Evidence:** the findings, each with its tag and the event references and queries behind it.
3.  **The action and its matrix entry:** what will be done, to which entity, and why it requires approval (stops a critical service, is irreversible, affects many entities, or Low confidence).
4.  **Blast radius:** the expected effect on operations, e.g., "disconnects the primary database server; the customer portal is unavailable until reconnected".
5.  **Rollback:** the exact call, script or procedure that reverses the action, or the statement that it cannot be reversed.

## 3. Human Assignee Conditions

Every Case has one assignee ([Detection & Analysis §2.3](../03-Processes/02-detection_and_analysis.md#23-case-assignment)). The assignee must be a **human** when the Case scope includes:

*   a **Crown Jewel** asset — a business-critical system as recorded in the [SOC Knowledge Base](../01-Foundation/definitions.md#soc-knowledge-base-soc-kb);
*   a **privileged identity** — an administrator, a service identity a critical service runs under, or an identity with equivalent reach.

The [handover](../01-Foundation/definitions.md#handover) happens the moment such an entity enters the scope, at triage or later, and records its reason in the Case (`handover_reason`: crown-jewel, privileged-identity). A human may also take over any Case at any time (manual). After a handover the previous executor keeps contributing: it runs the queries, produces findings and proposes actions, and the human assignee decides on them. A handover moves the responsibility for the verdict; it does not stop the pre-authorized containment actions of [Incident Response §2.1](../03-Processes/03-response.md#21-risk-based-autonomy-matrix-for-containment), and the human assignee may hand the Case back to automation or an agent once the entity leaves the scope.

Which actions require approval is not an assignee question: it is specified once, in the containment autonomy matrix of Incident Response §2.1, and applies to human and non-human executors alike.

## 4. Data-Handling & OSINT Egress Boundaries

Enrichment frequently sends data to public or third-party analysis services. To prevent data leakage and preserve operational security, the framework constrains what may leave the environment during triage, investigation and response — an **indicators-only** principle.

*   **Never submit organizational content or sensitive indicators** to public or third-party services: files, scripts and documents; **full URLs**, which may embed session tokens, personal data or internal hostnames; email or message bodies.
*   **Permitted:** querying non-attributable, pre-computed indicators — file hashes, and IP addresses or domains that are already public external infrastructure.
*   **Dynamic or behavioral analysis** of a suspected sample uses a private, isolated sandbox, never a public one.

**Rationale:** uploading organizational data to a public service risks a reportable data leak under NIS2 and DORA; submitting an attacker's implant or infrastructure to a public service tells the attacker the campaign is detected and prompts a change of infrastructure.

## 5. Resource & Token Metering

Inference spend is an operational resource like privilege or egress, and it is governed the same way: metered, budgeted and bounded. Agents are the metered executor class; deterministic automation reports zero token cost by definition ([Operational Metrics §7.2](../05-Metrics/operational_metrics.md)).

*   **Metering:** every model invocation records its input and output token counts, the model identifier and the Case that drove it — the §1 auditability rule extended from API calls to inference spend. Attribute names follow the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, adopted provisionally per [Design Decisions](../01-Foundation/design_decisions.md).
*   **Per-Case budget:** every Case carries a token budget scaled by severity; the values are an organization policy knob — the framework fixes the mechanism, not the numbers. Budget exhaustion is not a failure and not a handover: the executor applies the resolution rule of [Detection & Analysis §2.4](../03-Processes/02-detection_and_analysis.md#24-hypothesis-resolution-verdict-and-confidence) to the evidence at hand — at Triage, the decision of [§1.5](../03-Processes/02-detection_and_analysis.md#15-triage-decision) — and records the spend and the state reached in the Note. The assignee changes only under §3.
*   **Investigation timebox:** an automation or agent assigned a Case in Investigation has **10 minutes** for High and Critical severity and **20 minutes** otherwise to reach the resolution bar of Detection & Analysis §2.4; on expiry it applies that rule to the evidence at hand — closing as Insufficient Data with a monitoring watch when neither side is proven — and records the state reached. The values are reference values an organization may tighten.
*   **Per-action runaway ceiling:** independent of the Case budget, a per-action token ceiling bounds any single reasoning loop. Repeated identical tool calls or self-invocations trip the ceiling early: a runaway loop is recognized by its shape, not only by its cumulative bill. The value is an organization policy knob.
*   **Deterministic first:** a check resolvable by a query or a rule is executed as a query or rule, never as a model call — the enforcement of the manifest's [deterministic-first principle](../01-Foundation/framework_manifest.md#executor-neutrality-and-human-readability) and of the zero-token boundary rule in [Operational Metrics §7.2](../05-Metrics/operational_metrics.md).
*   **Feed to metrics:** these metering records are the sole input to the Token Economics metrics ([Operational Metrics §7](../05-Metrics/operational_metrics.md)). Estimated or sampled spend is not conformant: measurement is a by-product of this guardrail, never a parallel bookkeeping.
